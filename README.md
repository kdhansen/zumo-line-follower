# Line Follower for Zumo 32U4

This is an example of a line follower for the high-school/university collaboration "Viden Skaber". It is intended to be used with a Pololu Zumo 32U4.

The controller is intentionally not "optimal". The first assignment is to make the robot more agressive in following the line.
